"""
This file is used to submit Deadline Jobs from houdini using the Deadline rop (Render OPerators).

Overview:
It does this by performing a post order traversal of the Houdini Node Graph starting from the Selected Deadline Node in order to determine which nodes need to be submitted and what they have for dependencies.
This information is stored in a list of DeadlineJob Objects.  After this we are then submitting the nodes in a linear order to ensure that all dependecies are submitted before the dependent nodes.


Additional Information
Nodes will be submitted using the last encountered Deadline node in the path to that node.
If a node is encountered in multiple paths in the graph it will only be submitted a single time.
We are doing a post order traversal, so we are able to collect all dependent nodes before operating on the current node.
If a node is Locked, then it will be ignore for rendering and all of it's dependencies will also be ignored ( unless they are also dependencies of other nodes)
If a node is Bypassed, then it will be ignored for rendering, however it's dependencies will still be rendered.
Fetch Nodes are Pointers to other sections of a graph and are used to insert sub graph into a dependency chain ( can bring in nodes from other Networks)
